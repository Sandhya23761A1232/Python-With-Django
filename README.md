# Python-With-Django


Python with Django Lab  This repository contains my lab work and projects developed using Python and Django framework. It demonstrates the design and deployment of dynamic, interactive, and database-driven web applications.




---------------Hello World Application using Django-----------------
This project is a simple Django web application that displays the classic “Hello, World!” message on a web page. It serves as an introductory experiment to understand the basic setup, configuration, and execution of a Django project. The application demonstrates how to create a Django project, define a view, configure URLs, and render output to the browser.

🚀 Key Features:

Basic Django project and app creation

URL routing and view handling

Rendering text response (“Hello, World!”) to the client

Understanding Django’s MVC/MVT architecture

Local server setup and testing













---------------First Django Application – Python Web Development-----------

SRM is my first Django application built using the Django framework. It introduces the fundamentals of project setup, app creation, URL routing, views, and templates.

Key Features:

Django Project Setup → Created using django-admin startproject.

App Creation → Added an IT app inside the project for modular development.

URL Routing → Configured urls.py to handle different paths.

Views → Implemented basic request handling using Python functions.

Templates → Displayed HTML responses using Django’s template system.

Registration Form → A simple registration form (registration.html) is placed inside the IT app’s templates folder and rendered through a Django view.






------------Django Authentication System--------

This project is a Django web application that implements user authentication and management features. It demonstrates how to handle user registration, login, logout, and how administrators can manage registered users.

Key Features:

User Registration – New users can create accounts securely.
User Login & Logout – Authentication system using Django’s built-in auth module.
Admin Dashboard – Admin can view and manage all registered users.
Session Management – Ensures secure user sessions.
Template Integration – Clean and simple UI for authentication pages.






------------Django Carousel App---------------

🧩 About the Project:
A modern Django web application featuring a fully functional image carousel system that lets users easily upload, organize, and showcase images in a sleek, responsive slider layout. Built to demonstrate how dynamic media content can be integrated seamlessly into Django projects.

⚙️ Features:

📸 Add and display multiple images in a carousel

🧠 Dynamic content rendering using Django ORM

🪶 Clean and responsive UI with Bootstrap

🗂️ Admin panel for easy image management

🔄 Automatic carousel transitions with smooth animations









-------------Django Sample Page with Bootstrap Integration------------

This project showcases how to build a simple and responsive web page using Django as the backend framework and Bootstrap for frontend styling. It’s a beginner-friendly example for understanding how to integrate Bootstrap with Django templates and static files.

🚀 Features

Responsive design using Bootstrap 5

Django template inheritance (base and child templates)

Static file management (CSS, JS, Images)

Simple and clean user interface

Easy-to-understand project structure for beginners






-------------------Login and Registration System using MVC Architecture in Django---------------------------

This project demonstrates how to build a Login and Registration Page using the Django Framework while following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern (implemented as Model-View-Template (MVT) in Django).

It provides a secure and structured way to handle user authentication, session management, and form validation, making it a perfect foundation for larger Django applications.

🚀 Features

User Registration with validation

Secure Login and Logout functionality

Password hashing for user security

Session-based authentication

Django Model-View-Template (MVC) structure

Responsive front-end with HTML & CSS











 ---------User Authentication System using Django (MVC Architecture)--------------

This project is a User Authentication Web Application developed using the Django Framework, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. It allows users to register, log in, and log out securely, ensuring proper validation and session management.

The Model layer handles database operations using Django’s ORM, the View layer manages the application logic, and the Template layer acts as the Controller interface to display dynamic content.

This project demonstrates essential concepts of Django such as:

URL routing

Form handling and validation

Session and authentication management

Template rendering and dynamic data display

⚙️ Features

🔐 User Registration with form validation

🔑 Login & Logout functionality

🧠 Password hashing for secure authentication

🧾 Session management to maintain user state

🖥️ MVC-based structure (Models, Views, Templates separation)

💡 Simple and clean UI using Bootstrap
